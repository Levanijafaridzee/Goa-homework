        As per Nissan's intention of creating a world beating sports car, the GT-R brand was
         revived as part of the Nissan Revival Plan. Overall development began in 2000, following
          seven years of development and testing, including the introduction of two concept models
           in 2001 and 2005. The production version of the GT-R was unveiled at the 2007 Tokyo Motor
            Show. The GT-R is a brand-new car built on the PM platform, and featured innovative 
            concepts and technologies, such as advanced aerodynamics, the VR38DETT engine, an active 
            suspension system and the ATTESA E-TS Pro all-wheel-drive system, making it the first
             ever rear mounted independent transaxle all-wheel-drive vehicle. It is one of the first
              production cars to feature launch control and a dual-clutch transmission as well.
               The overall body is made out of steel, aluminium and carbon-fibre.
                In 2009 it set a record for the fastest accelerating 4-seater production car.
