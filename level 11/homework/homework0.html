    <h1>about  Nissan GT-R</h1>

  
    <h3> is a car built by Japanese marque Nissan since 2007. It has a 2+2 seating 
        layout and is considered both a sports car and a grand tourer. The engine
         is front-mid mounted and drives all four wheels. It succeeds the Nissan 
         Skyline GT-R, a faster variant of the Nissan Skyline. Although this model
          was the sixth-generation to bear the GT-R name, it is no longer part of the 
          Skyline line-up. The car is built on the PM platform, derived from the FM
           platform used in the Skyline and Nissan Z models. Production is conducted
            in a shared production line at Nissan's Tochigi plant in Japan.
